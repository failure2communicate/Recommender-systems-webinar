    "The objective of the webinar is to offer an introduction to the main types of recommender systems and the algorithms behind them. As result, I'm not going to focus on explaining every single line of code rather I'll only be focusing on the parts that are central to understanding the concepts behind recommender systems. I'll also make the notebook public to everyone who has signed up for the webinar so you'll be able to go over my code and test it out for yourself. I also left a lot of comments and notes in the notebook which will hopefully make it easier for you to test the out code for yourself.\n",

    "If you've ever found yourself browsing the movie catalogue of Netflix, spending hours to just find something interesting to watch, then you've faced the exact same problem recommender systems are trying to solve: __helping us decide what to buy or consume.__\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"netflix.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the big question is why is deciding what to purchase so difficult? First of all, often times we're incapable to convey our own tastes into words. For example, although we know what movies we liked in the past we don't fully understand the factors that made us like those movies. Also, there are times when we don't even know what we need or what we like. As a result, in many cases we're unable to translate our needs into specific products or items to buy or consume. Second of all, these factors are also exacerbated by a phenomenon called choice overload. It turns out, when were're faced with many options, as in the case of Netlix, we find it much harder to make a deicison than when we're faced with only a few.\n",

    "This is where __recommender systems__ come into play, as they intend to exploit the inefficiencies in our decision making process by providing us with relevant product recommendations. Take for example Amazon's recommender system: \n",

    "## 1.) Types of recommender systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the main purpose of a recommender system is to increase sales or consumption of a product. Of course this can be achieved by providing a user with __relevant__ product recommandations. Relevant meaning products which the user finds both interesting and useful enough to buy or consume. There are two main approaches to building these types of a recommender  systems: __Collaborative Filtering__ and __Content-based Filtering__.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.) Collaborative filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Collaborative filtering algorithms work on a very basic principle: people tend to like products similar to other products they have liked or purchased in the past and also products that people with similar tastes have liked or purchased. As a result, collaborative filtering approaches employ the preferences of users to calculate similarities between users or products, and then use these similarities to make recommendations. For example, if my preferences are similar to that of another costumer it might be a good idea to recommend me products that the other costumer has bought and liked but I haven't. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.) Content-based filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "> On the other hand content-based filtering algortihms rely on calculating similarities between products by looking at their attributes. For example, in the case a movie attributes can be considered the movie genre, the director, the cast or even the year the movie was released in. And the way these attributes are used to provide recommendations is somewhat similar collaborative filtering: items that a user has positively rated are collected and other similar items to these examples are recommended for him. For example, if I watched the movie The Departed and gave it five stars it might be a good idea to recommend me movies which belong to the same genre or have the same director or the same cast.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An important concept both methods employ are user preferences. There are two main methods though which users can express their preferences: __implicit feedback__ or __explicit feedback__. In the case of explicit feedback, users manually provide feedback for the products they have consumed. For example they give a rating for a movie they have watched. On the other hand, implicit feedback is gathered from the interaction users had with specific products. For example, if a user bought a specific item or clicked in a specific product, we can consider that interaction as positive feedback. The first important concept to remember is that when building recommender systems we are always dealing with user-item interaction matrices:"

    "Another important concept is that of similarities. Both content-based methods and collaborative filtering methods measure similarities between users or items to make recommandations. In matematical terms, these similarities can be expressed as measures of similarity or distance between two vectors. As a result, we need to express users or items as vectors:"

    "## 2.) Recommandations as prediction problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches to formulating recommandations as prediction problems: \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Rating prediction:__ The first approach is to predict the rating value for a user-item combination. It is assumed that training data is available, indicating user preferences for items. For m users and n items, this corresponds to an incomplete m × n matrix, where the specified (or observed) values are used for training. The missing (or unobserved) values are predicted using this training model. This problem is also referred to as the matrix completion problem because we have an incompletely specified matrix of values, and the remaining values are predicted by the learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Top-k ranking:__ In practice, it is not necessary to predict the ratings of users for specific items in order to make recommendations to users. Rather, a merchant may wish to recommend the top-k items for a particular user. This problem is also referred to as the top-k recommendation problem, and it is the ranking formulation of the recommendation problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, the absolute values of the predicted ratings are not important. The first formulation is more general, because the solutions to the second case can be derived by solving the first formulation for various user-item combinations and then ranking the predictions. However, in many cases, it is easier and more natural to design methods for solving the ranking version of the problem directly.\n",

    "## 3.) Evaluating recommender systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main environments through which recommender systems can be evaluated: __online__ and __offline__. The best way to measure the quality of a recommendation is to actually see how a user reacts to it. This can be only done when a recommender system is already in production. However, before we can put a system into production we need a method to evaluate it offline. For this, we are going to be using RMSE:\n",

Here we will only visualise the distibution of the ratings and the distribution of the number of ratings. We can notice that people prefer to use round numbers when giving ratings and also that the majority of the ratings are around 3 and 4 stars. Most movies also have very few ratings or none at all."

In other words, we extract some information from the dataset, and use that as a \"model\" to make recommendations without having to use the complete dataset every time. This approach potentially offers the benefits of both speed and scalability. I won't be able to go into a lot of detail but one of the methods model based approaches use is matrix factorization. I'll make sure to leave links to a couple of very good reasources that explain how matrix factorization works but for now I'll only show you how to implement SVD using the __surprise__ library.\n",
